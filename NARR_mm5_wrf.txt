Using NARR data to run MM5 applications, you need variables at all vertical levels and 
flux variables at the boundaries. The vertical levels are in the regrouped "3D" files. 
The flux variables are in the regrouped "flx" and "sfc" files. Since there are many new
variables, we may adjust our regrouping strategy to minimize the number of files needed
to run MM5 applications.
